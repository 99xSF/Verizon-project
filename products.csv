FACS has 3 main components: LFACS - contains the outside plant inventory (includes cable and pair) SOAC - monitors and controls the service order flow SWITCH - contains the central office inventory (includes office equipment). Once an order is released from a Consultant's Service Order Processor (MISOSSOP/DOE or SOACS) it enters the Assignment Phase. The first system it encounters is FACS. This is the term applied to the network of systems that assigns outside facilities (cable pair) as well as inside facilities (central office equipment).

Network and Services Database,ERICSSON INC,Telecom Network Management,Inventory Management,Network and Services Database. NSDB serves as the corporate circuit database. It provides access to corporate data by authorized systems or administrators. NSDB is capable of storing Special Services message carrier and non-designed circuit data along with circuit customer data. NSDB is also responsible for redundancy management and the relational integrity of the data that it stewards or owns. NSDB is interfaced with numerous systems including WFA/C NMA/F Delphi SOAC and NAMS.
Workforce Administration Control (WF A/C),ERICSSON INC,Telecom Network Management,Inventory Management,"Workforce Administration Control.  Work Force Administration / Control coordinates and tracks the installation activities for an entire circuit from the receipt of a work request to the completion of the request. WFA/C provides mechanized and automatic processing of the human and machine tasks required to install and repair Special Services, message, carrier, and non-design (POTS) circuits and services. Additionally, WFA/C provides ready access to detailed circuit records, pending work items and a history of circuit activity. Features in WFA/C facilitate automatic flow-through of work items from the receipt to the completion of a work request."
Workforce Administration Dispatch In (WF A/DI),ERICSSON INC,Telecom Network Management,Inventory Management,"Work Force Administration / Dispatch In automates the service provisioning and service assurance work functions for those centers and associated central office locations which control the activities of inside technicians. WFA/DI supports centers in two major areas: 1) Service provisioning - by supporting the provisioning process for Special, message, carrier, and non-designed services circuits; 2) Service assurance - by supporting the maintenance process for all equipment and services for which the center is responsible. This may include, but is not limited to, troubles on non-designed, Special, message, and carrier circuits and equipment and switching troubles."
Workforce Dispatch Administration Dispatch Out (WF A/DO),ERICSSON INC,Telecom Network Management,Inventory Management,"Work Force Administration / Dispatch Out automates the work assignments of technicians who work outside of the Central Offices to install and maintain telephone services.

LEIS is a closely knit package of planning design and economic study modules that work through common databases to eliminate redundancy. Keeps track of loop pairs and cables for the engineers.
Mechanized Recent Change (MARCH),ERICSSON INC,Telecom Network Management,Inventory Management,The MARCH (Mechanized Recent Change) application translates line- related service order data from FACS into switch-provisioning messages and automatically transmits these messages to targeted switches in the wire centers. The switches in the wire centers are the actual machines which provide customers with their dial tone service. In addition to dial tone changes made on a subscriber's telephone line thru the switch can include: adding call waiting changing long distance carrier changing office equipment. These changes are referred to as recent change messages (RCM) and play a critical role in providing service to our residence and business customers. The date due on the service order will determine when the actual order will be delivered to the switch and the service activated. Orders will be placed in a pending file in March until the due date. March also maintains a history file of changes that can be used to restore the switch's memory if necessary. Access to the MARCH application is through the secure datakit node. These nodes are part of the OSN datakit network and maintain by the OSN group. Users must use a secure ID card along with a passcode to access the application.
